# ⏳ Pomodoro Widget

Welcome to my tiny productivity companion!  

This is a minimalist **desktop Pomodoro timer** I built to help me (and maybe you!) stay focused while working, studying, or creating.  
Whether you’re here to explore, get inspired, or fork it into your own version — hello & welcome! 🪄

## ✨ About the Widget

Made with **Electron** and **React**, this little widget sits quietly on your desktop and helps structure your work sessions.  
I wanted it to feel *lightweight*, *friendly*, and *distraction-free* - just a helper, never a hassle.

## 🌸 Why I Made This
I’m drawn to UI/UX that feels gentle and personal.
I made this widget because I often work best in timed focus sessions, and I wanted something small, simple, and styled just for me and others that struggle with similar
problems!

## 🎧 Extras
- Built-in timer end sound that gently fades in
- “Exit” button powered by Electron IPC (so you can close the widget anytime)
- Smooth, lightweight — just enough to help without interrupting
